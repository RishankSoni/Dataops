## Data Augmentation Techniques

In this repository, we apply data augmentation techniques to improve the performance of an image classification model that distinguishes between cats and dogs.

- The original data is in the folders `cats` and `dogs`.
- The new augmented data is in the folders `augmented_cats` and `augmented_dogs`.

The model selected is: `microsoft/resnet-50`. The results on both datasets are compared and observations are noted.
